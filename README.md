install python then for windows open a cmd or for linux open a console then type the following commands 
pip install discord.py
pip install python-dotenv
pip install websockets

this is easy to convert to C++ or C#
remember to edit your discord details in the .env file 
and if you want to run the Basic_Console.py or the Listen.py you have to edit the file manualy with the server details

for windows use the .bat files to strart them 
for linux just make a start.sh
and add the files
